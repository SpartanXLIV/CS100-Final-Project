## Expectations **
> 1) The user should be able to create tasks and add descriptions to them.
> 2) The user should be able to set a PRIORITY on their task, which will sort the provided tasks by which is more important

## Project Description **
 > We wanted to take on a project that seemed challenging and fun and that could actually benefit us as coders in our futures. This program will basically function the same way as a "reminder" app that are found on most smart devices. The user enters a task and can add a descritption and subcategories to the task. The user can also set a due date or a "priority" check that will list the tasks in order of most relevant. The user should also be given the option to search/sort by genre type (Work, Academic, Personal)
 > ## What is it?
 > This project should tackle on the issue of organization specifically prioritization.
 > ## What language are you using?
 > The application will consist of C++ in programming the software in addition to the features added.
 > ## How should the application function?
 > The input would be the task itself, its description, and subcatagories. The output would be whatever would make sense for the user to want to display. We'll be using the console to take in input and display output.
