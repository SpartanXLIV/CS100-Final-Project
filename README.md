## Project Description
 > We wanted to take on a project that seemed challenging and fun and that could actually benefit us as coders in our futures.
 > We plan to code mainly using C++
 > The input would be the task itself, its description, and subcatagories. The output would be whatever would make sense for the user to want to display. We'll be using the console to take in input and display output.
